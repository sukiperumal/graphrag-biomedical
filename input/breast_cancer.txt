Background: Inﬂammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive disease, accounting for 2–4% of
new cases of breast cancer. Owing to its aggressive nature, IBC represent approximately 8–10% of breast
cancer deaths. Management of IBC requires a multidisciplinary team for decision-making involving a
composite of systemic treatment, surgery, and radiation, or ‘‘Trimodality Treatment.” Because of the rar-
ity of the disease, systemic therapy of IBC traditionally has been extrapolated from non-IBC clinical trials.
Aim of Review: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the development of systemic treat-
ment of IBC from the past to the present by focusing on IBC clinical trials, including chemotherapy and
targeted therapies.
Key Scientiﬁc Concepts of Review: We discuss their effects on pathologic complete response (pCR) and sur-
vival outcomes, the predictive markers, and the adverse events of these therapies. Further, we summa-
rized the current standard treatment stratiﬁed by molecular subtypes based on clinical data. Finally,
we discuss the future trend of systemic therapy, including immunotherapy and ongoing IBC clinical trials.

cancer (IBC) is a unique, rare entity with more aggressive behavior
and worse prognosis than non-IBC or locally advanced breast can-
cer (LABC) [1]. In the United States, the incidence of IBC is 1.6–3.1
per 100,000 women with a higher incidence among black women
and younger women, but owing to its aggressive nature, IBC repre-
sents approximately 8–10% of breast cancer deaths. [1,2]. Black
women with IBC have worse survival than white women regard-
less of hormone receptor (HR) status and age [3,4]. Asian women
with IBC tend to have longer survival than white women [3]. The
survival is signiﬁcantly shorter in IBC compared with non-IBC [5].
The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for stage IV IBC is only 25–33%
[6]. For de novo stage IV disease, the median OS time is 2.27 years
for IBC but 3.40 years for non-IBC [7]. For stage III disease, the med-
ian OS is 4.75 years for IBC in contrast to 13.40 years for non-IBC
[8]. Therefore, we classify IBC as a high-risk disease because of
its high rate of distant metastasis (approximately 30–40%) at ﬁrst
diagnosis, and approximately 80% of stage III IBC has clinical lymph
node involvement [9,10].
Deﬁnition of IBC
According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edi-
tion) [11], diagnostic criteria for IBC (T4d) are based on clinical
diagnosis by a rapid onset of diffuse erythema and edema (or peau
d’orange) involving approximately at least one-third of breast skin,
with or without an underlying palpable mass. The skin changes
may be due to lymphedema caused by tumor emboli within der-
mal lymphatics, which may be present or absent in biopsy speci-
mens. Although tumor emboli are a hallmark of IBC, only around
75% of diagnosed IBC cases show tumor emboli on pathologic anal-
ysis [12]. Interestingly, we classify the presence of tumor emboli in
dermal lymphatics without any skin changes as non-IBC breast
cancer [11]. The onset of symptoms in IBC should be rapid, within
no more than 6 months [11,13].
Subtypes and characteristics of IBC
Like non-IBC, IBC can be categorized into four subtypes; hor-
mone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2-negative (HER2), HR+/HER2-positive (HER2+), HR-
negative (HR)/HER2+, and HR/HER2- (or triple-negative recep-
tor status) [6,14,15]. Bone is the most common metastasis site in
all the subtypes; liver metastasis has frequently occurred in the
HER2+ subtype; and lung metastasis has frequently occurred in
the triple-negative subtype. IBC has lung/pleural effusion metasta-
sis around 21–29% [16]. As in non-IBC, triple-negative IBC has the
worst survival outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate of less than
30% [6,17]. Approximately 15% of IBC develop brain metastasis
[18]. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEERs) database and our institute also showed the same results
that triple-negative IBC has a higher rate of brain metastasis than
non-IBC [18,19]. Our institute also reported that survival after
brain metastasis in IBC was shortest in the triple-negative subtype,
with a median OS of 3.8 months [18]. In contrast, after brain
metastasis, HER2+ subtype IBC showed the longest median OS of
16.6 months, and the improvement of survival in HER2+ subtype
relates to the anti-HER2 therapy era [18].
Pathological complete response
Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a well-known prognostic
marker of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer, including IBC. Its
deﬁnition is the absence of residual invasive cancer in the com-
plete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph
nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy
(ypT0/Tis ypN0 in American Joint Committee on Cancer staging
system [11]). pCR predicts long-term survival outcomes, including
event-free survival and OS [15,20–22]. Similar to non-IBC patients,
IBC patients who experience pCR status have better survival than
non-pCR, and those with HR/HER2+ IBC have the highest pCR rate
among all the subtypes. However, triple-negative IBC remains to
have a poor outcome despite achieving pCR [15,23].
Treatment of IBC
Historically, local treatment of IBC by surgery or radiation alone
has shown poor results, with a 5-year OS rate of less than 5% [24].
Systemic neoadjuvant regimens are a critical part of IBC treatment.
Currently, the management of IBC requires a multidisciplinary
team comprising a medical oncologist, surgeon, pathologist, diag-
nostic radiologist, and radiation oncologist. The principal goal of
this team is to improve the survival of IBC by determining the opti-
mal combination of systemic treatment, surgery, and radiation, or
‘‘trimodality treatment” [25].
However, at present, even though all standard guidelines
[26,27] have deﬁned IBC separately from non-IBC disease, the sys-
temic treatment used in the clinic is still the same as that used for
non-IBC. Current IBC systemic treatment has been extrapolated
from non-IBC clinical trials and stratiﬁed by breast cancer molecu-
lar subtypes the same way as in non-IBC. In recent years, clinical
research, including clinical trials, has investigated the potential
role of several new systemic regimens in patients with IBC, but
quite limited the number of patients. In this review article, we
summarize the clinical data, including clinical trial results, regard-
ing systemic treatment speciﬁcally for IBC, and we discuss the efﬁ-
cacy and toxicity of these treatments.
Developments of systemic treatment for IBC
Various systemic treatments have been used for breast cancer
worldwide. The optimal selection of systemic treatment strategy
depends on both tumor and patient characteristics. We discuss
the systemic therapy of IBC from the past to the present
(chemotherapy and targeted therapy eras). Further, we summarize
the current standard treatment in real practice stratiﬁed by sub-
types based on clinical trials. Finally, we provide the future direc-
tion of systemic therapy (immunotherapy era).
Chemotherapy
A large retrospective study from MD Anderson reported that
178
IBC
patients
treated
with
upfront
anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, combined with radiation therapy with or without
mastectomy, had an objective response rate of 74%, a median OS
of 37 months, and a 10-year OS rate of 33% [22]. These results
are consistent with those of other anthracycline-based studies in
IBC, which have reported a 10-year OS rate of 27–35% [28–30].
As in non-IBC, paclitaxel is well known as an active agent against
breast cancer. Cristofanilli et al. [31] showed that adding taxane
to a ﬂuorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC)–based
regimen in 240 IBC patients improved the pCR rate from 10% to
25% (p = 0.012). Paclitaxel addition regimen also had a numerically
longer median OS in the study than did the FAC-based regimen
alone (52 vs. 41 months, p = 0.11) and a statistically signiﬁcantly
longer OS among estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER-) patients
than other subtypes [31]. Furthermore, paclitaxel showed beneﬁt
in
anthracycline-refractory
IBC,
in
which
44%
of
IBC
non-
responders who treated with FAC regimen four cycles became
resectable after treatment with paclitaxel [32].
Many studies have demonstrated that increased dose intensity
improves the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy in breast cancer [33]. For

IBC, studies of chemotherapy dose intensity were undertaken
based on data from prospective studies of non-IBC and reported
results speciﬁc to an IBC cohort. Ditsch et al. [34] reported 101
IBC patients treated preoperatively with either epirubicin followed
by paclitaxel every 2 weeks (dose-dense sequential group) with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support or standard
combination chemotherapy every 3 weeks. After surgery, all
patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate, and 5-ﬂuorouracil), radiation therapy, and anti-
hormonal therapy if clinically indicated. The dose-dense sequential
group and the standard group did not signiﬁcantly differ in pCR
rate (12% vs. 10%, respectively; odds ratio = 1.27; p = 0.33) or in
OS (hazard ratio = 1.4, 95% CI 0.71–2.75, p = 0.327). Similarly, Ellis
et al. [35] enrolled patients with high-risk breast cancer in a phase
3 randomized clinical trial, including 115 patients with IBC and
249 patients with LABC. All patients were randomized into two
groups, treated with a neoadjuvant standard-dose (21-day) dox-
orubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen or a weekly AC reg-
imen with G-CSF support (dose-dense), and both groups were
subsequently treated with weekly paclitaxel. The pCR rate in IBC
patients was numerically higher in the dose-dense group com-
pared with the standard, 21-day group, but the difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant (27% vs. 13%, p = 0.60).
The efﬁcacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) depends on
the breast cancer subtypes, ER- IBC has a higher pCR rate than
ER-positive IBC, as same as in non-IBC [36]. Response evaluation
by imaging in the middle of NAC also predicts ﬁnal pathologic
response in IBC; breast MRI, in particular, showed a better correla-
tion than did mammography or sonography [37]. For predictive
gene expression signatures, hyperactivation of IFN-a and hypoacti-
vation of EGFR, p53, and TGF-b were associated with pCR in IBC
after treatment with NAC [38]. This study also found that the pre-
dictive gene signatures were signiﬁcantly enriched for immunity-
related genes involved in CD8-positive T-cell lymphocyte activa-
tion processes, suggesting that adaptive immunity determined
response to chemotherapy in IBC [38].
Today, there are no data from large randomized controlled trials
for IBC; therefore, anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy
are still recommended as the backbone of primary chemotherapy
regimens
by
international
expert
consensus.
However,
the
chemotherapy schedule and dose density can differ between cen-
ters where have their own IBC specialized clinics [39].
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplant
Before 2000, high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) was
extensively investigated for IBC with the same rationale as that
of studying dose-intensity relationships. In 1997, the International
Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry reported a 3-year OS rate of
52% in 253 IBC patients treated with HDCT with AHSCT [40]. A lar-
ger and updated registry of HDCT with AHSCT, comprising 527 IBC
patients and 2,860 non-IBC patients from the Center for Interna-
tional Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, reported a 10-year
OS rate of approximately 30% with no difference between IBC
and non-IBC [41]. However, among non-metastatic patients with
no evidence of disease at transplant, the 10-year OS was worse
for IBC patients than for non-IBC patients (37% vs. 45%, respec-
tively; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis in this study showed worse
outcomes for stage III IBC than for stage III non-IBC. Multiple
single-arm phase 2 trials of AHSCT speciﬁcally for IBC patients
have reported varying pCR rates of 17–39%, 3-year OS rates of
68–72%, and favorable prognostic factors including HR positivity,
the involvement of less than four axillary lymph nodes, and receipt
of adjuvant radiation [42–44].
Owing to the diversity of these pilot studies [42–44] of HDCT
with AHSCT for IBC, the French PEGASE experience perform larger,
randomized comparative studies to demonstrate the survival ben-
eﬁt of HDCT with AHSCT for non-metastatic IBC: two phase 2 clin-
ical trials (PEGASE 02 and PEGASE 05) and one phase 3 clinical trial
(PEGASE 07). PEGASE 02 [45] treated 100 IBC patients with four
cycles of high-dose FAC plus G-CSF and with the administration
of AHSCT after cycles 3 and 4. The pCR rate was 32%, and the 3-
year OS rate was 70%. Febrile neutropenia was the most frequent
adverse event, resulting in 85% of rehospitalizations. One case
had treatment-related death by septic shock. The phase 2 trial
PEGASE 05 sought to determine the efﬁcacy of adding dose-
dense docetaxel to the high-dose AC regimen with AHSCT. After
54 patients were enrolled, the study was prematurely stopped
owing to toxicity (eight cases had a severe infection, and two cases
died of febrile neutropenia). In the 48 patients analyzed, the pCR
rate was 30%, similar to that of PEGASE 02. The investigators con-
cluded that adding dose-dense docetaxel did not improve the pCR
rate and was too toxic [46,47].
In the randomized clinical trial PEGASE 07 [48], 174 IBC patients
were treated with HDCT, comprising epirubicin (150 mg/m2) and
cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2), with G-CSF support for four cycles fol-
lowed by AHSCT. After surgery and radiation, patients were ran-
domized to either observation or adjuvant therapy with four
cycles of docetaxel (85 mg/m2) and 5-ﬂuorouracil (3000 mg/m2),
with continuous infusion for 4 days. There were no differences in
5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (55.0% vs. 55.5%, respectively;
hazard ratio = 0.947, 95% CI 0.61–1.48, p = 0.810) or in 5-year OS
rate (70.2% vs. 70.0%, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.938, 95% CI
0.55–1.60, p = 0.814). The pCR of both arms was 20%.
Although many publications have shown the efﬁcacy of HDCT
with AHSCT in IBC, the standard of care did not change because
randomized trials of this approach showed a lack of positive bene-
ﬁts, and the presence of toxic risks, including fatal infection, is a
major problem. Also, the chemotherapy agents used in high-dose
trials are currently not commonly used to treat IBC in the clinic.
Furthermore, predictive biomarkers to guide the use of HDCT with
AHSCT in IBC have not been discovered. Finally, HDCT was associ-
ated with worse quality of life [49]. Therefore, there is no currently
recommended role for this strategy for newly diagnosed IBC.
Targeted therapy
At present, there are limited targeted therapy studies speciﬁc to
IBC. Because IBC classiﬁed as a high-risk disease, systemic targeted
therapy of IBC has mainly based on extrapolation of data available
from the high-risk group of non-IBC studies.
a Trastuzumab
IBC has higher rates of HER2 overexpression than does non-IBC,
with an estimated prevalence of 25–35% in IBC [50–53], and tras-
tuzumab has been approved for HER2+ disease in both early and
metastatic stages. Many randomized controlled trials have con-
ﬁrmed the survival beneﬁts of NAC combined with trastuzumab
for patients with LABC, including IBC [54,55]. However, the number
of IBC patients was limited in those trials. The NOAH study [54], a
randomized phase 3 clinical trial, enrolled 235 patients with HER2
+ LABC (including 47 IBC patients) and evaluated the efﬁcacy of
neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with
NAC alone. The NAC regimen was doxorubicin and paclitaxel for
three cycles, followed by paclitaxel for four cycles, and then
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and ﬂuorouracil for three cycles.
Subgroup analysis in IBC showed that the addition of trastuzumab
increased the 5-year event-free survival rate (64% vs. 24%, hazard
ratio = 0.34, 95% CI 0.15–0.80) and 5-year OS rate (74% vs. 44%, haz-

ard ratio = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15–0.95) without any serious cardiac
events. The efﬁcacy of trastuzumab was conﬁrmed in single-arm
studies speciﬁcally for IBC [56,57], which reported a high pCR rate
of
54–66%
for
patients
with
HER2+
IBC
treated
with
an
anthracycline-containing regimen plus trastuzumab without rele-
vant cardiac toxicity. The NOAH study also reported that the
HER2+/HR subtype was a predictive marker for the efﬁcacy of
trastuzumab addition, with a hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–
0.91) for OS and a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% CI 0.35–0.94) for
event-free survival. Now, trastuzumab is a part of the anti-HER2
backbone for the HER2+ IBC.
b Pertuzumab
Pertuzumab is a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
that binds the HER2 receptor at a different epitope from that
bound by trastuzumab, instead of binding to the subdomain II
of the HER2 extracellular domain and preventing HER2 from
dimerization with other ligands HER receptors, most notably
HER3 receptor [58]. Like trastuzumab binding, pertuzumab bind-
ing induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [59].
Because of these similar but distinct mechanisms of binding to
HER2 epitopes, the concept of the synergistic combination of per-
tuzumab with trastuzumab was tested in clinical trials [55,58,60].
In the NeoSphere trial [55,61], a phase 2 randomized neoadju-
vant trial enrolled 417 patients with breast cancer, including 29
IBC patients. All patients were randomized into four neoadjuvant
arms: docetaxel plus trastuzumab, docetaxel plus trastuzumab,
and pertuzumab (THP), trastuzumab and pertuzumab without doc-
etaxel, and docetaxel and pertuzumab. After surgery, all patients
were
treated
with
adjuvant
5-ﬂuorouracil,
epirubicin,
and
cyclophosphamide (FEC) and adjuvant trastuzumab for 1 year.
NeoSphere reported promising pCR rates: 45.8%, the highest, in
the THP arm; 29.0% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab; 16.8% for tras-
tuzumab and pertuzumab without docetaxel; and 24.0% for per-
tuzumab plus docetaxel. Rates of cardiac adverse events were
similar between all arms (4–5%). At the 5-year follow-up, Neo-
Sphere [61] reported progression-free survival rates of 81% for doc-
etaxel plus trastuzumab, 86% for THP, 73% for trastuzumab and
pertuzumab without docetaxel, and 73% for pertuzumab plus
docetaxel.
TRYPHAENA [62], a randomized phase 2 study, evaluated the
safety and tolerability of dual anti-HER2 antibodies combined with
NAC in 225 patients, including 13 IBC patients. All patients were
randomized into three groups: FEC regimen plus pertuzumab and
trastuzumab followed by THP; FEC followed by THP; and docetaxel
and carboplatin plus pertuzumab and trastuzumab (TCHP). The
incidence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) declines was
low, around 4–5% in each group. Interestingly, this study reported
pCR rates of 50.7%, 45.3%, and 51.9%, respectively. At the 3-year
follow-up for TRYPHAENA, DFS and OS did not signiﬁcantly differ
between groups [63].
Overmoyer et al. reported the efﬁcacy of neoadjuvant weekly
paclitaxel combined with pertuzumab and trastuzumab, followed
by surgery in only IBC patients. All patients received post-
mastectomy radiation, maintenance pertuzumab and trastuzu-
mab for 36 weeks, and an adjuvant AC regimen for the non-
pCR case. This study was closed owing to slow accrual, with
20 IBC patients. The pCR rate was 56%, and toxicity was minimal
[64].
Now, a regimen containing pertuzumab plus trastuzumab is a
standard neoadjuvant treatment for HER2+ IBC. In contrast to
non-IBC, IBC is classiﬁed as a high-risk disease, and escalation
strategies are preferred over de-escalation strategies. Therefore,
short-duration or lower amounts of anti-HER2 therapy should be
avoided.
c Lapatinib
Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
blocks intracellular HER2 and EGFR (epidermal growth factor
receptor) signaling pathways [65]. The GeparQuinto study [66], a
randomized neoadjuvant phase 3 trial, enrolled 620 HER2+ breast
cancer patients (including 83 IBC patents). They were then treated
with four cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by
four cycles of docetaxel combined throughout all cycles with either
trastuzumab or lapatinib. The pCR rate was higher in the trastuzu-
mab arm than in the lapatinib arm (30.3% vs. 22.7%, odds
ratio = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47–0.97, p = 0.04). However, the trastuzumab
and lapatinib arms did not differ in 3-year OS rate (91.7% vs. 93.6%,
respectively; p = 0.297) [67]. Interestingly, the combination of NAC
with lapatinib had a lower pCR rate than expected in HER2+
patients. Similarly, a phase 2 IBC trial reported a low pCR rate of
17.6% in 32 patients with HER2+ IBC treated with neoadjuvant
paclitaxel and lapatinib [68]. Concerning adverse events seen with
lapatinib included diarrhea and rash, found around 50% of cases
and sometimes leading to dose reduction or discontinuation of
treatment [66,68]. One IBC study of NAC plus lapatinib was prema-
turely stopped owing to severe toxicity (>15% of patients) [69].
Combination chemotherapy plus lapatinib is currently not recom-
mended to treat newly diagnosed IBC due to a low response rate
and concerning toxicity.
Like trastuzumab, the HER2+ subtype is a strong predictive
marker for lapatinib efﬁcacy [68]. One study also reported that
co-expression of phosphorylated (p) HER2 and pHER3 in IBC
patients was associated with response to lapatinib [70]. Further-
more, a proof of concept for the synergistic combination of lapa-
tinib and trastuzumab has been demonstrated in the clinical
trial. The NeoALTTO trial [71] reported promising results of dual
antibody treatment with trastuzumab plus lapatinib combined
with paclitaxel in HER2+ early breast cancer; the pCR rate for dual
anti-HER2 combination was 51.3%, higher than that of paclitaxel
combined
with
single-antibody
treatment
with
trastuzumab
(29.5%) or lapatinib (24.7%). However, most combination trastuzu-
mab and lapatinib studies have excluded IBC patients or did not
report their inclusion.
d Trastuzumab emtansine
Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate
that has efﬁcacy against breast cancer and acceptable toxicity. The
conjugate comprises trastuzumab linked with the cytotoxic anti-
microtubule agent DM1 (emtansine) and acts by directly binding
on HER2 receptors of tumor cells. T-DM1 gains intracellular entry
via endocytosis, and DM1 is released by lysosomal degradation
[72]. Notably, T-DM1 is cytotoxic by itself, without coupling with
chemotherapy. The KRISTINE trial [73], a randomized phase 3 trial,
evaluated neoadjuvant treatment with a T-DM1 plus pertuzumab
regimen or a TCHP regimen in 444 patients with HER2+ breast can-
cer, including IBC. Unfortunately, the pCR rate was signiﬁcantly
higher for the TCHP regimen than for T-DM1 plus pertuzumab
(56% vs. 44%, respectively; p = 0.016). However, the TCHP regimen
had a higher rate of serious adverse events (31% vs. 29%), including
febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Therefore, T-DM1 plus
pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting is not superior to trastuzu-
mab plus pertuzumab–containing regimen in terms of response;
however, T-DM1 is more favorable in terms of toxicity. Therefore,
the T-DM1 plus pertuzumab regimen is another option for patients
in whom the TCHP regimen is not well tolerated.
Recently, the KATERINE trial [74] evaluated adjuvant therapy in
patients with HER2+ breast cancer who did not experience a pCR
after treatment with a taxane-based regimen plus trastuzumab. A
total of 1,486 patients, including 22 IBC patients, were randomized

to treatment with either adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14
cycles. The primary endpoint, invasive DFS, deﬁned as freedom
from invasive breast cancer recurrence or death, was 88.3% in the
T-DM1 group and 77% in the trastuzumab group with a hazard
ratio of 0.50 (95%CI 0.39–0.64, p < 0.001). However, adjuvant
anti-HER2 therapy should be considered, as shown by a previously
published study. An APHINITY trial [75] showed greater beneﬁt
from adjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab than adjuvant trastu-
zumab alone in lymph node-positive disease or high-risk node-
negative disease: 3-year invasive DFS rates were 94.1% and
93.2%, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% CI 0.66–1.00,
P = 0.045). In summary, adjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab
are recommended in HER2+ IBC who achieve a pCR, and adjuvant
T-DM1 is recommended in IBC cases with a non-pCR.
e Neratinib
Neratinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to
EGFR, HER2, and HER4. The ExteNET study showed beneﬁt from
adjuvant neratinib for 1 year after completion of adjuvant trastu-
zumab, with an invasive DFS rate of 90.2% compared with 87.7%
from placebo (hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI 0.57–0.92, p = 0.008)
[76]. After amendments, the eligibility of the ExteNET study was
restricted to patients with high-risk recurrent disease (e.g., node-
positive disease). Therefore, the role of adjuvant neratinib should
be considered with high-risk recurrent disease like IBC. However,
the toxicity risk of neratinib should also be considered, particularly
diarrhea, which is the most common adverse event (grade 3, 40%;
grade 4, 0.1%).
f Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against circulating vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a known angiogenesis acti-
vator
in
tumors.
In
preclinical
data,
the
combination
of
bevacizumab with taxane-based chemotherapy inhibited tumor
growth and metastasis of IBC cells (SUM149) [77]. In clinical data,
three studies evaluated the addition of bevacizumab to neoadju-
vant therapy, speciﬁcally in IBC patients.
The BEVERLY-1 and BEVERLY-2 studies, with similar study
designs, evaluated the pCR rate in non-metastatic IBC patients with
both
HER2-
(BEVERLY-1)
and
HER2+
(BEVERLY-2)
disease.
BEVERLY-1 [78], a single-arm phase 2 study, treated HER2- IBC
patients (n = 100) with an FEC regimen plus bevacizumab for four
cycles followed by docetaxel plus bevacizumab for four cycles.
After surgery, patients received adjuvant radiation, adjuvant beva-
cizumab for ten cycles, and adjuvant hormonal therapy as clinically
indicated. Results were disappointing, with a low pCR rate of 19%,
similar to the pCR rates in the studies of chemotherapy without the
targeted therapy mentioned above. Around one-third of all
patients had serious adverse events, including febrile neutropenia,
mucositis, and peritonitis. Rates of toxicity related to bevacizumab
were 20–40% (e.g., hypertension, proteinuria, and wound-healing
complications). The 3-year DFS was 57%, and the 3-year OS was
75%.
The BEVERLY-2 study investigated neoadjuvant therapy plus
bevacizumab in non-metastatic HER2+ IBC (n = 52). All patients
received neoadjuvant therapy with FEC plus bevacizumab for four
cycles, followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab combined with
bevacizumab for four cycles. As in BEVERLY-1, after surgery, all
patients received adjuvant radiation, adjuvant trastuzumab plus
bevacizumab continuing up to about 1 year, and adjuvant hor-
monal therapy as clinically indicated. In contrast to BEVERLY-1,
BEVERLY-2 showed a promising pCR rate of 63%. The 3-year DFS
rate was 68%, and the 3-year OS was 90% [79]. Again, around
one-third of patients had serious adverse events, including febrile
neutropenia, anal abscess, and LVEF decrease. BEVERLY-2 also
reported that among patients with no detection of circulating
tumor cells at baseline (<1 cell/7.5 ml) and achieved a pCR were
a good prognosis with a high 3-year DFS rate of 98% [79].
The third study, by Palazzo et al., assessed the pCR rate in 34 IBC
patients treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and oral cyclophos-
phamide combined with bevacizumab for 24 weeks before surgery.
If tumors were HER2+ or HR+, trastuzumab and endocrine therapy
were added as indicated. The pCR rate was 29% overall, 57% in
HER2+ cases, 20% in triple-negative cases, and 0% in the HR+ sub-
type. The treatment was well tolerated; only one patient developed
a serious adverse event of grade 4 neutropenia [80].
Concerning
predictive
biomarkers,
a
pooled
analysis
of
BEVERLY-1 and BEVERLY-2 [81] again reported that patients with
no detection of circulating tumor cells at baseline (<1 cell/7.5 ml)
and a pCR showed good prognosis, with a high 3-year OS rate of
94%. The AVEREL study [82], a randomized phase 3 trial, aimed
to evaluate ﬁrst-line therapy with docetaxel and trastuzumab with
or without bevacizumab in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. The
study reported that VEGF-A showed potential as a biomarker for
bevacizumab efﬁcacy; a high plasma concentration of VEGF-A
was associated with greater beneﬁt from therapy than a low con-
centration. This result was consistent with the BEATRICE study
[83], which also found that high plasma VEGF-A concentration
was associated with greater beneﬁt from adding bevacizumab to
neoadjuvant therapy. However, the absolute differences in the
beneﬁts associated with VEGF-A were not statistically signiﬁcant.
Bevacizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion for metastatic breast cancer; however, the approval was with-
drawn after safety and efﬁcacy concerns arose. At present, the role
of bevacizumab is used in certain circumstances with paclitaxel for
metastatic breast cancer [26].
g Panitumumab
Around one-third of IBC cases typically express EGFR, and
higher EGFR expression correlates with worse prognosis [84,85].
The humanized anti-EGFR antibody, panitumumab, besides being
approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer, also has clinical
efﬁcacy in breast cancer. In a single-arm phase 2 study, panitu-
mumab was combined with preoperative carboplatin and nab-
paclitaxel for four cycles, followed by an FEC regimen for four
cycles in 47 patients with newly diagnosed HER2- IBC regardless
EGFR expression status, leading to a pCR rate of 28% [86]. The
triple-negative IBC subtype had the highest pCR at 42%. Among
the expressed proteins of baseline tissues, only pEGFR expression
was associated with pCR (p = 0.05), but EGFR was not (p = 0.14).
Hematologic toxicity was moderate, 30% of patients had grade 4
neutropenia, and 15% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. The
most frequent non-hematologic toxicity related to panitumumab
affected the skin; six patients (15%) had grade 3 skin rash. To our
knowledge, this targeted therapy study is the ﬁrst to show a high
pCR for the poor-prognosis disease triple-negative IBC [86]. Now,
an ongoing clinical trial is evaluating combination NAC plus pani-
tumumab for IBC (NCT01036087) in Table 1.
h Pazopanib
Pazopanib is a small-molecule multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
of VEGFR1-3, FGFR1 and -3, PDGFRa and -b, and c-Kit. A random-
ized phase 2 study, VEG20007 [87], evaluated ﬁrst-line lapatinib
plus pazopanib therapy or lapatinib monotherapy in patients with
HER2+ locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer (n = 190),
including IBC. HER2+ status was deﬁned as 3+ by immunohisto-
chemistry or HER2 gene ampliﬁcation by ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization. The primary endpoint was the rate of progressive

disease after 12 weeks. Progression rates did not differ between the
combination therapy and lapatinib monotherapy (36.2% vs. 38.9%,
p = 0.37). However, the most common grade 3–4 adverse events
were twice as frequent in the combination arm compared with
the monotherapy, e.g., diarrhea (9% vs. 5%), hypertension (5% vs.
0%), and fatigue (4% vs. 0%) [87]. Another study [88] speciﬁcally
for metastatic HER2+ IBC patients included 76 IBC patients treated
with lapatinib (1500 mg) plus pazopanib (800 mg); this cohort was
prematurely closed because of a high incidence of grade 3–4 toxi-
city. In a second cohort, 88 IBC patients were randomized to treat-
ment with pazopanib (400 mg) plus lapatinib (1000 mg) or
monotherapy with either lapatinib (1500 mg) or pazopanib
(800 mg). The overall response rate was numerically highest in
the combination arm, at 58%; response rates for monotherapy lap-
atinib and pazopanib were 47% and 31%, respectively. Median
progression-free survival was the same in the combination and
lapatinib monotherapy arms (16 weeks) and was 11.4 weeks for
pazopanib monotherapy. Again, combination therapy had a higher
rate of serious adverse events than did lapatinib monotherapy (24%
vs. 11%, respectively). There are no further clinical trials of pazopa-
nib for breast cancer to date.
i Other targeted therapies
Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that has shown
preclinical activity in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines [89]. A phase
2 clinical trial evaluated afatinib with or without vinorelbine in
metastatic HER2+ IBC. However, the trial was stopped early after
another study showed that afatinib was associated with shorter
survival, 26 IBC patients who remained showed a clinical beneﬁt
rate of 35% from afatinib monotherapy [90]. An oral multi-
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, was evaluated in a phase 2 trial
in combination with NAC in patients with HER2- LABC or IBC
(n = 70). The neoadjuvant treatment was sunitinib combined with
weekly paclitaxel followed by AC regimens with G-CSF. Disap-
pointingly, overall results showed a low pCR rate of 24% [91].
Over two decades, there have been many changes in systemic
treatment leading to improved survival outcomes for breast can-
cer, speciﬁcally IBC (Fig. 1). We had chemotherapy as a tool against
breast cancer in the past, and today we have a combination of tar-
geted therapy and chemotherapy, which has a higher pCR rate. Not
all strategies or agents are effective in IBC (e.g., the HDCT strategy
has a higher pCR rate than conventional chemotherapy but has too
great a toxicity risk). Now, we know that the identiﬁcation of
breast cancer subtypes dictates the prognosis and speciﬁc treat-
ment. Therefore, practical treatment guidelines in the era of per-
sonalized medicine are classiﬁed by subtypes.
The current standard of care for newly diagnosed IBC
Based on the above information and international consensus on
IBC [39], based on collaboration with experts from high-volume
centers, there is broad agreement that upfront systemic treatment
should be administered before surgery. This systemic treatment
comprises sequential treatment with anthracycline-based and
taxane-based
chemotherapy,
with
or
without
carboplatin.
Although different centers with IBC clinics may administer slightly
different systemic regimens, the backbone chemotherapy regimen
is the same. We present the current neoadjuvant and adjuvant
therapy for IBC from our center in Table 2. These recommendations
differ according to the IBC subtype.
a Triple-negative
Anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy remain the
backbone of neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative IBC. A dose-
dense regimen may be integrated into some situations, but both
risks and beneﬁts need to be considered. The addition of carbo-

platin to a neoadjuvant regimen increases the pCR rate in TNBC
[92,93], but these data do not include IBC patients. Hence, there
are no data to support carboplatin for IBC [39]. A randomized phase
3 study, CREATE-X [94], showed that patients with HER2- non-pCR
breast cancer treated with adjuvant capecitabine had longer OS
than those given an adjuvant placebo (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI
0.39–0.90), suggesting that adjuvant capecitabine for six to eight
cycles can be considered in cases without a pCR. Interestingly, a
more pronounced OS beneﬁt was observed in triple-negative dis-
ease (hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% CI 0.30–0.90).
b HR-positive
The response rate to NAC is low in HR+ breast cancer compared
with TNBC. Nevertheless, NAC, similar to that used in TNBC, is rec-
ommended for HR+ breast cancer. As for adjuvant therapy, a key
consideration is that IBC carries a high risk for recurrence. Further-
more, ER+ breast cancer has a risk of recurrence after 5 years.
Therefore, extended adjuvant endocrine therapy can help reduce
recurrence risk. The use of either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibi-
tors for extended adjuvant therapy for up to 10 years has been
associated with improved survival outcomes in breast cancer
[95–98]. Among premenopausal breast cancer patients, based on
the TEXT and SOFT trials, the addition of ovarian suppression to
adjuvant endocrine therapy showed higher rates of DFS and OS
in high-risk patients than endocrine therapy alone [99].
Despite the potential survival beneﬁt of extended adjuvant
endocrine therapy and ovarian suppression, these approaches also
may incur their own adverse events and long-term toxicity. For
example, the addition of ovarian suppression increased the rate
of osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and depression
[99]. Some of these adverse effects may be treatable; for example,
the use of bisphosphonate can increase bone density and may also
improve survival in breast cancer patients [100]. Now, an ongoing
trial of adjuvant endocrine therapy plus immune checkpoint inhi-
bitors in patients with non-pCR, HR+/HER2- breast cancer after
neoadjuvant therapy is enrolling (NCT02971748).
c HER2-positive
For HER2+ IBC, based on the NeoSphere and TRYPHAENA trials,
the recommended neoadjuvant therapy is a regimen containing

pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (dual anti-HER2 antibodies) in com-
bination with an anthracycline-containing regimen (speciﬁcally,
THP for four cycles followed by an anthracycline-containing regi-
men for four cycles). No data are demonstrating the superiority
of dual anti-HER2 antibodies with a non-anthracycline regimen
(TCHP regimen for six cycles) over the dual anti-HER2 antibodies
with the anthracycline-containing regimen, because the primary
endpoint of TRYPHAENA trial [62] was safety and tolerability,
which cannot be used to determine conclusions about the efﬁcacy
of each regimen. Therefore, we still have recommended the dual
anti-HER2 antibodies in combination with an anthracycline-
containing regimen for HER2+ IBC.
Even for patients who experience a pCR after neoadjuvant ther-
apy, those with HER2+ IBC are still at a high risk of recurrence [15].
Adjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab for 1 year are recom-
mended in HER2+ breast cancer based on the APHINITY trial [75],
which showed beneﬁt from adjuvant dual anti-HER2 antibodies
in high-risk patients. In HER2+ IBC cases without a pCR, adjuvant
T-DM1 is recommended (KATERINE trial [74]). After the comple-
tion of adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy, neratinib is recommended in
the high-risk situation, especially non- pCR patients, and should
discuss to risk-beneﬁt assessment for pCR patients [76]. However,
grade 3–4 diarrhea was commonly found (40%) with neratinib
compared with placebo (2%), leading to discontinuation of nera-
tinib in up to 28% of patients treated with neratinib [76]; anti-
diarrheal prophylaxis should be offered.
d De novo stage IV IBC
For patients with de novo stage IV IBC, we recommend similar
systemic treatment to that of non-metastatic IBC, intending to
achieve optimal response. Patients should then be evaluated for
surgery and radiation therapy by a multidisciplinary team. In cases
that show a response or stable disease after neoadjuvant therapy,
local therapy at the primary breast tumor (e.g., modiﬁed radical
mastectomy followed by radiation) should be discussed working
with a multidisciplinary team. Although the survival impact of
local therapy of the primary tumor in the metastatic setting is con-
troversial, loco-regional progression in IBC can lead to serious mor-
bidity [39].
Immunotherapy and future directions
Role of immunotherapy in clinical data
Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accelerated
approval of the anti–PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor ate-
zolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with
unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
whose tumor expresses PD-L1 (1%), based on phase 3 randomized
trial
(IMpassion130)
[101].
In
the
neoadjuvant
setting,
immunotherapy for breast cancer has been investigated in two
randomized
trials,
KEYNOTE-522
[102]
and
I-SPY2
[103].
KEYNOTE-522
studied
the
combination
of
anti–PD-1
(pem-
brolizumab) with preoperative chemotherapy, carboplatin plus
paclitaxel followed by the AC regimen, in patients with TNBC (in-
cluding IBC patients), followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab, met
one of the dual-primary endpoints (pCR rate). The combination
of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy showed signiﬁcant improve-
ment in pCR rate compared with placebo plus chemotherapy
(64.8% vs. 51.2%, P < 0.001). The improved beneﬁt was consistent
with respect to the pCR rate across subgroups, including both
PD-L1 expressions positive or negative. Besides, an ongoing phase
2 trial, the adaptively randomized I-SPY2 trial [103], is evaluating
the effect of pembrolizumab on pCR rate in high-risk stage II-III
breast cancer. This study is using multiple investigational arms in
parallel and using the standard neoadjuvant arm as the common
control arm; weekly paclitaxel for 12 cycles followed by AC regi-
men for 4 cycles. They reported the pCR rate of HER2- patient trea-
ted with weekly paclitaxel plus every 3 weeks of pembrolizumab
for 12 weeks, then AC regime for 4 cycles was 44% compared with
pCR rate of control arm 17%. For the triple-negative subtype and
the HR+/HER2- subtype, pCR rates were 60% and 30%, respectively,
in the pembrolizumab arm but 22% and 13%, respectively in the
control arm.
Future directions
Previously mentioned studies suggest that the combination of
an immune checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy increases
response rate and efﬁcacy in breast cancer; however, the number
of IBC patients in those trials was limited. A study from our insti-
tute showed that PD-L1 was expressed in 36.8% of IBC tumor cells
on immunohistochemical staining (monoclonal rabbit anti–PD-L1
antibody, clone 28-8). PD-L1 expression in the tumor was not asso-
ciated with clinicopathologic characters, including histologic type,
tumor grade, or ER, progesterone receptor, or HER2 status; how-
ever, PD-L1–positive tumors (>1% of tumor cells) were associated
with worse OS [104]. The incidence of PD-L1 expression in this
study was similar to that of a study by Bertucci et al., which
reported PD-L1 overexpression in 38% of IBC tumor cells and 28%
in non-IBC tumors, according to mRNA expression using DNA
microarray [105]. On the other hand, PD-L1 mRNA overexpression
was associated with ER- status, basal and HER2+ subtypes, and
higher pCR rate after NAC, but not OS [105]. PD-L1 expression is
found not only in tumor cells but also in tumor-inﬁltrating lym-
phocytes (TILs), which are considered to be the main effector of
immunotherapy. Arias-Pulido et al. reported 221 IBC samples had
PD-L1 positivity of 66% in the TILs and more than 8% in the tumor
cells and also showed that PD-L1 expression (5%) in the TILs was
associated with the better DFS [106]. Berckelaer et al. reported 105

IBC samples had PD-L1 positivity (1%) in the TILs, more than in
the TILs of non-IBC samples, 42.9% vs. 23.7%, respectively [107].
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that PD-L1 is an immune
checkpoint molecule that is found in both the tumor cells and the
TILs of IBC more frequently than in non-IBC, and thus is a potential
predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. Beyond the combination
of chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, as used in
the KEYNOTE-522 and I-SPY2 trials, our institute also demon-
strates IBC preclinical data supporting a combination of targeted
therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor [108]. Further, an
anti-EGFR agent combined with an anti–PD-L1 antibody inhibited
the growth of IBC tumors more than either single-agent treatment
(unpublished data). Even if immunotherapy studies conducted
speciﬁcally in IBC patients have not been established, these ﬁnd-
ings provide a rationale for future studies of the use of immune
checkpoint inhibitors as a part of IBC treatment. To ﬁll this gap
in knowledge, ongoing immunotherapy studies are enrolling
patients with IBC in many trials, as shown in Table 1. Another issue
is a slow accrual problem of IBC clinical trials; multicenter clinical
trials are an important key to resolve this problem. Hopefully, clin-
icians and researchers will be motivated to cooperate.
Conclusion
Frequent distant metastases and poor prognosis indicate that
IBC is a unique entity rather than a subtype of LABC. IBC has high
potential for fatality, urgently necessitating the development of
novel systemic treatments. This review shows that anthracycline
and taxane are the backbone of chemotherapy and remain a cur-
rent treatment. We do not have scientiﬁc evidence to deescalate
the treatment as in non-IBC settings. We have learned from the
past that high-dose chemotherapy with AHSCT is too toxic a strat-
egy, with no apparent beneﬁt. In the targeted therapy era, only
anti-HER2 therapies have been incorporated into the current stan-
dard IBC treatment. Recently, a high pCR rate has been produced by
immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-IBC; the preclinical ﬁndings
suggest a possible role for immunotherapy in IBC in the future. We
hope this review provides a foundation of knowledge for the devel-
opment of new treatment approaches, especially for IBC-speciﬁc
clinical trials. Utilizing a multicenter approach in a global level is
a key to improved success of IBC clinical trials.
