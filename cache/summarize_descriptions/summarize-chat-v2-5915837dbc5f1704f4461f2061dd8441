{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe \"95% CI\" is a statistical measure used to estimate the range of values within which a true value is likely to lie. Specifically, it refers to a confidence interval with a confidence level of 95%. This confidence interval is a statistical measure used to estimate treatment effectiveness, providing a range of values within which the true value is likely to lie. In other words, the 95% CI is a statistical tool that helps to quantify the uncertainty associated with a particular measurement or estimate, providing a range of values within which the true value is likely to fall.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by combining the descriptions to provide a clear and concise summary.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
