Specifically, it can be seen in the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which has a synergistic effect, meaning that the two entities work together to produce a result that is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Additionally, the concept of synergistic combination is also associated with the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab, suggesting that this combination also exhibits a synergistic effect.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
