{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nTILs (Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes) are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in immunotherapy, particularly in the context of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). They are more frequently found in IBC than in non-IBC, indicating a specific association with this type of cancer. TILs are associated with PD-L1 expression, which is linked to better disease-free survival (DFS). As immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment, TILs are an important component of the immune response against cancer.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
