{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nPCR, also known as pathological complete response, is a measure of treatment effectiveness in breast cancer. It refers to the absence of residual cancer cells after treatment, including neoadjuvant therapy. PCR is a promising outcome and a term used in studies to describe it. The rate of pathological complete response, or PCR, is a percentage of patients who achieve this outcome, and it is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of cancer treatment, particularly in patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
