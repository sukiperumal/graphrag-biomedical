The study was a single-arm phase 2 trial that aimed to assess the effectiveness of a treatment regimen in this patient population. The study also explored the use of circulating tumor cells as a biomarker for treatment effectiveness. Additionally, BEVERLY-1 was an event where a study on bevacizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative IBC was conducted.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
