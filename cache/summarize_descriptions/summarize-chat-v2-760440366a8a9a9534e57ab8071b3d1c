{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe \"TRIPLE-NEGATIVE SUBTYPE\" refers to a type of breast cancer that lacks specific receptors. Specifically, it is characterized by being negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 receptors. This means that the cancer cells do not have these receptors on their surface, which are typically targeted by hormone therapy and HER2-targeted therapies.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by combining the two descriptions, ensuring that the summary is accurate and coherent.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
