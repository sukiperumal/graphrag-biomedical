{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n\"OS\" refers to overall survival, a measure of the length of time patients with breast cancer survive after treatment. It is a clinical outcome in breast cancer and a term used in studies to describe overall survival. OS is a measure of overall survival rate, which is a measure of treatment effectiveness. It is also a measure of the efficacy of trastuzumab addition in patients with HER2+/HR- subtype. In the context of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), OS refers to the overall survival rate. Overall, OS stands for overall survival, which is a measure of cancer treatment effectiveness.\n\nI hope this summary meets your requirements!
