The incidence of PD-L1 expression in this\nstudy was similar to that of a study by Bertucci et al., which\nreported PD-L1 overexpression in 38% of IBC tumor cells and 28%\nin non-IBC tumors, according to mRNA expression using DNA\nmicroarray [105]. On the other hand, PD-L1 mRNA overexpression\nwas associated with ER- status, basal and HER2+ subtypes, and\nhigher pCR rate after NAC, but not OS [105].
