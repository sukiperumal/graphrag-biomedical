It is a gene expression signature associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) in IBC. EGFR is also expressed in IBC cases, with higher expression correlating with a worse prognosis. Additionally, EGFR is a protein expressed in breast cancer, also associated with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, EGFR is a target of neratinib, a protein that is targeted by this therapy.
