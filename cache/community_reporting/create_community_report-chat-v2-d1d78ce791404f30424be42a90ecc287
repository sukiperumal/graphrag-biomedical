This subtype is typically treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab as a standard neoadjuvant treatment.

Pertuzumab is also used to treat HER2+ breast cancer, especially in combination with trastuzumab, by blocking the HER2 protein. As a targeted therapy, it targets HER2 receptors and induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pertuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 receptor and is used in breast cancer treatment.
